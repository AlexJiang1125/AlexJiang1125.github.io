Pleased to meet you! I am a statistics Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Washington](https://stat.uw.edu/). Prior to that, I received a B.E. in industrial engineering at Tsinghua University.

Jointly advised by [Abel Rodriguez] (https://sites.stat.washington.edu/people/abelrod/Home.html) and [Jon Wakefield] (https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/), I am very passionate about developing scalable Bayesian inference methods for complex data, including [spatial] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13270) and [temporal event sequence] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-024-10392-x) data. In particular, I am interested in tackling machine learning problems like regression, clustering and latent variable modeling under the lens of nonparametric Bayes. 

In my spare time, I watch many movies, go to lots of live concerts and sometimes [write reviews] (https://xavj.wordpress.com/).
